# Heart Disease Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction using UCI Dataset with basic ML algorithms and a Tkinter-based GUI.

This project predicts the presence of heart disease using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. It involves:
. Data cleaning and preprocessing
. Training several machine learning models:
. Logistic Regression
. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
. Decision Tree
. Random Forest
. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
. Visualization of results and feature importance
. GUI built with Tkinter for user input and prediction

The project is built with Python using libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and tkinter.
